  <h2>Bats</h2>
  <div class="first-paragraph">
<p class="tab" style="margin-top: -14px;margin-left:5px;">
  When you hear the word bat, what do you think of? Count
  dracula? A vampire? Transylvania? Echolocation? Well, they are also excellent
  pollinators. Many of these pollinator bats are usually found in other parts of
  the world. There are over 300 species or fruit that are actually dependent on
  these bats. Some are in Mexico and the southern United states, however the vast
  majority live in Africa, southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Since bats
  are nocturnal, they only come out in the night. This is helpful to flowers
  that bloom during the night, because during the day they might not be
  pollinated by other pollinators since they do not open up at that time.</p>
<p class="tab" style="margin-top: -14px;margin-left:5px;">
    Although the pollinating bats are very important to hundreds of species of
    plants, other types of bats are useful too. Many other species of bats eat
    insects, this can prove useful to many farms because they will eat the most
    destructive of pests. Pregnant mothers can eat up to their whole body weight
    in insects!  These bats are also important for the quality of the soil, their
    droppings can help to fertilize the soil which can make it richer and
    healthier for the crops. Most bats will usually go for quite large flowers
    that are very pale, or smell fermented like fruits. The fruits they mainly
    pollinate include, mangoes, bananas, and mangoes.</p>

    <h2>The Mexican Long-Tongued Bat</h2>
    <div class="first-paragraph">

  <p class="tab" style="margin-top: -14px;margin-left:5px;">
The Mexican long-tongued bat  is one of the few pollinating bat species in North
 America. It is typically found in Mexico, hence that part of their name, but is
 also found in much of the southwestern United States of America, specifically in
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. These bats are usually three inches
tall, and their tongues are about a third of their body, making them typically
one inch. They were previously endangered in 1988 however made a speedy recovery,
this was due to lots of Agave harvesting, which is used to make liquor, and the
fact that Agave plants do not lastthat long.</p>

  <h2>Lesser Long-Nosed Bat</h2>
  <div class="first-paragraph">
<p class="tab" style="margin-top: -14px;margin-left:5px;">
  The Lesser long-nosed bat is another one of the few pollinating bat species in
  North America. It is also predominantly found in Mexico. However they can also
  thrive in the southern United States, typically in Arizona and New Mexico. These
  bats are usually 3 inches in size, with a wingspan of 10 inches. What helps then
  with the pollination is their long tongue, it is the size of their body! This
  helps them reach the nectar in the flowers. These bats were also previously
  endangered but taken off the list in 2018.</p>
